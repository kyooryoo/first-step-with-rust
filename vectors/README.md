# Vectors
Vectors are mutable arrays.
Elements must have the same data type.
Vector size or length could change.
However, out of bound error still stands.

Use *vec!* macro or with *Vec::new()* method
Use keyword *mut* if value or length will change.

Add element with *<vector>.push(<element>)*.
Remove and return element with *<vecotr>.pop()*.

Display vector with *{:?}* in println! macro.
Elements could display with *{}* in println!.
